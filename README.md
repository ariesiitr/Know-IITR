Project Report:- 
 SUMMARY
“Know IITR” is an augmented reality-based app specifically created for visitors to IIT Roorkee. Its purpose
is to address the challenges faced by visitors when navigating the campus and understanding the
historical and significant aspects of the various buildings. By providing an easy-to-use and engaging
solution, the app aims to enhance visitors’ experiences and deepen their appreciation for IIT Roorkee.
Using augmented reality and 3D models, “Know IITR” offers an immersive and informative experience for
users. The app features three prominent buildings on the campus: James Thompson, Convocation Hall,
and the Electrical Department. By scanning the marker associated with a specific building, the app
showcases a 3D model of that structure, allowing visitors to explore it virtually.
To further enrich the experience, the app incorporates an AI model that provides detailed information
about the selected building. Users can access historical, architectural, and other relevant details through
the app, enhancing their understanding of the campus and its structures.
This app “Know IITR” provides visitors to IIT Roorkee with a unique and interactive way to navigate the
campus, explore significant buildings, and gain valuable insights into the rich history and architectural
marvels that define the institution.

DEVLOPMENT

The App is Completely Made Using Unity, the 3d Model was made using Blender and the following SDKs
were Used:-
1) Unity: Unity is a powerful game development platform that was utilized to create the
entire app. Unity provides a wide range of features and capabilities, including 3D
rendering, physics simulation, animation, and cross-platform deployment.
2) Blender: Blender is a popular 3D modeling and animation software used to create the 3D
models of the buildings featured in the app. Blender offers a comprehensive set of tools
for modeling, texturing, rigging, animation, and rendering, allowing for the creation of
detailed and realistic virtual assets.
3) AR Core: AR Core is an augmented reality software development kit (SDK) developed by
Google. It was used in “Know IITR” for image tracking and AR development. AR Core
enables the app to recognize specific markers associated with each building, facilitating
the placement of virtual 3D models on the real-world environment captured by the
device’s camera.
4) Ready Player Me: The Ready Player Me SDK was integrated into the app to enable the
importation of custom 3D models. Ready Player Me is a platform that allows users to
create personalized avatars and other virtual assets. By using this SDK, “Know IITR”
enables users to incorporate their own custom 3D models into the app, enhancing the
personalization and customization options.
5) Google Text To Speech (TTS): The Google Text To Speech SDK provides the capability to
convert on-screen text into audio in real-time. In “Know IITR,” this SDK is used to
generate audio feedback and information based on the textual content displayed within
the app. This feature allows users to receive spoken descriptions and details about the
buildings and other elements of interest.
6) OVR Lipsync for Unity: The OVR Lipsync for Unity SDK is employed to synchronize the
movements of the 3D character’s lips with the audio generated by the TTS system. This
SDK utilizes machine learning techniques to accurately match the lip movements of the
virtual character with the corresponding audio, resulting in a more realistic and
immersive user experience.
“Know IITR” app is developed using the Unity game development platform, with 3D models created
using Blender. The app incorporates the AR Core SDK for image tracking and AR development, Ready
Player Me SDK for importing custom 3D models, Google Text To Speech SDK for converting text to audio
in real-time, and OVR Lipsync for Unity SDK for synchronizing lip movements with audio. These
technologies and tools collectively contribute to creating an engaging and immersive augmented reality
experience for users exploring IIT Roorkee.

External Software Used

1. READY PLAYER ME:
Ready Player me was used to upload the Avatar Model
in unity in current scene.By Ready player me, we can
create our own avatar or customize given model.RPM
configuraƟon enables to do model seƫngs like model
body movement features.

2. GOOGLE TEXT TO SPEECH
Firstly, we were using CHATGPT for audio content but it was
generaƟng unwanted content so instead of it, we have used
Google text to speech for the same purpose. For this we need
to provide content(text) input. To do this following step are
followed:

3. OVR LIPSYNC FOR UNITY
This was used for For Syncing the Lips of the model with the Audio
following steps:

4. Blender:
Blender was used to create 3D models of buildings.
Following models were used:
